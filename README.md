# Sparse-High-Dimensional-Unbalanced-Tabular-Data
The dataset is highly dimensional and consists of ~530 rows, 16,500 columns, is highly unbalanced, and sparse

TO-Do: Add L1 regularization (compel the network to minimize the sum of its absolute parameter values; adopt sparse parameters that are more important and minimize the footprint of the network
